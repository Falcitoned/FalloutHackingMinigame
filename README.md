# **Fallout Hack Minigame**

### This project is an excercise of mine pulled from the /r/dailyprogrammer page on reddit. It is consistently being worked on and iterated through to make improvements.

### ---Game Descriiption---

For those not familiar, this minigame consist of giving you a selection of words, of one of which is the correct passowrd. You are given 4 attempts to guess the correct password. If you guess the incorrect word, it will tell you how many letter placements in your guess matched the password. This allows you to (ideally) narrow down the available options using deductive reasoning and comparing your guesses number of correct letter placements.
There are a set of five default difficulties, ranging from Very Easy to Very Hard that increase the length of the words and the number of different options you have with each difficulty level. There is also an option in the application to create your own difficulty levels, and consequently, your own set of different dfficulty level ranges.

##### A help command is included to gain more details around the specifics of the details.
