The below items are planned enhancements for areas of the application that do not follow best-practice or adhere to proper SOLID principles.

    1) Refactor code to be more future proof:
	    A) Move 5 default diff levls to DiffLevel class and expose them to the main program.
	    B) Add customizable variable for number of guesses for each difficulty level.
	    C) Turn the password class into more of a service based object.
     
    2) Add additional commentation and refactor variable naming to follow Hungarian notation.
    3) Address remaining UserInput edge cases (if still present after refactor)
